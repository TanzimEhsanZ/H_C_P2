                <p>Born in Magura, Khulna, Shakib started playing cricket at an early age. According to Prothom Alo
                    sports editor Utpal Shuvro, Shakib "was fairly proficient at cricket and was often hired to play for
                    different villages and teams".[22][23] In one of those matches Shakib batted aggressively and bowled
                    fast, as he usually did, but also chose to experiment with spin bowling which proved to be not so
                    effective. He was picked to play for Islampur and took a wicket with his first ball; it was his
                    first delivery with a proper cricket ball, having previously played with a taped tennis
                    ball.[22][23] He spent six months training at Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protishtan,[22][23] a
                    government-run sports institute.[24]
                    Shakib played his debut Under-17 match against UAE Under-17s in 2003 in the ACC Under-17 Cup where
                    he got a bowling figure of 3â€“18 in 8 overs (with 2 maiden overs).[4]
                    In May 2004, at the age of 17, Shakib made his first-class debut for Khulna where he got a bowling
                    figure of 0/116 of 30 overs in the 1st innings and 3/92 of 28 overs in the 2nd innings. He also
                    scored 13 of 11 with three 4s in the 1st innings and 16 of 43 in the 2nd innings. His 1st
                    first-class wicket was Rakibul Hasan.[5]
